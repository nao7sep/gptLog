# gptLog

A lightweight desktop utility for collecting, organizing, and saving ChatGPT conversation snippets.

## Overview

gptLog is a narrow-scope desktop utility that helps a single user manually collect, organize, and save ChatGPT conversation snippets. It features a minimal UI optimized for keyboard workflow and clipboard-centric operations.

### Key Design Goals

- **Minimal UI** â€“ Optimized for keyboard workflow, clipboard-centric
- **Zero web-scraping** â€“ User copies text via ChatGPT's "Copy" button
- **Unambiguous data** â€“ Each message is explicitly tagged as *User* or *Assistant*
- **Reliable storage** â€“ JSON file with line-level fidelity and metadata

## Features

- Simple clipboard monitoring for easy message capture
- Clear visual distinction between user and assistant messages
- Message reordering, insertion, and deletion
- Conversation metadata including title and timestamps
- Safe file saving with temporary files and backups
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## System Requirements

- .NET 8.0 Runtime
- Supported platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux

## Installation

1. Download the latest release for your platform from the releases page
2. Extract the archive to your preferred location
3. Run the gptLog executable

## Usage

    },
    "messages": [

            ]
        },
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "lines": [
                "I'm doing greatâ€”how can I help you?"
