# gptLog

A desktop utility for collecting, organizing, and saving ChatGPT conversation snippets.

## Purpose

gptLog is a narrow-scope desktop utility that helps a single user manually collect, organize, and save ChatGPT conversation snippets. The application is designed with the following key goals:

- **Reliable storage** - JSON file with line-level fidelity and metadata

## Features

- Clipboard monitoring for easy message capture
- Message organization with move up/down functionality
- Support for both User and Assistant message types
- Visual distinction between message types
- Conversation metadata storage
- Keyboard shortcuts for common operations
- Cross-platform compatibility
